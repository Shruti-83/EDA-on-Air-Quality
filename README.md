🌫️ Air Quality EDA India
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on air pollution data from India to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NOx, SO₂, and more. Visualizations and statistics are used to analyze pollution levels over time and across locations.

About the Project
The aim is to understand air quality trends across Indian cities by analyzing pollution data. This EDA helps identify pollutant hotspots, trends over years, and seasonal patterns in air quality.
